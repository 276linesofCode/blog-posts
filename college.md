Team 276linesofCode - Rails Girls Summer of Code

We are Brihi Joshi and Shravika Mittal in our Sophomore year of college at IIIT - Delhi.
We have been working on Tessel this summer since July 1st. It has been a great experience so far writing our application in February, waiting for the results in May, becoming a part of the RGSoC Community finally and working since then.

Who are we?

The Team is an amalgamation of all things tech and electronic. We are a dynamic duo that believes in learning and strengthening concepts while on the way to developing something. Nobody knew that two individuals, who met each other on the first day of the Induction Programme would get along so well that they would end up doing a project together after exploring the website of RGSoC in December 2016. We got more insight into the same by attending a workshop organized by our seniors who were RGSoC 2016 scholars.

Brihi - She is majoring in Computer Science Engineering and loves to mix and fiddle with creativity in code. She brings in the caffeine-induced, late night coding sessions along with fresh experiments in the team.   

Shravika - She is an majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. It's been hardly a year since she's got her hands dirty with programming, and it's already a vital part of her daily schedule. She brings out dedication and hard work in the team.

After we decided to apply for this, the major task we had to fulfil was to find coaches for us who would guide us through the course of our project. We got in touch with a two of them through Twitter, one coach is in Hong-Kong and we contacted her via Google Groups, two of our coaches are from IIIT-Delhi itself and there is another coach whom we met at a Women Who Code, Delhi meetup.

What is RGSoC?

Rails Girls Summer of Code is a three month long award-winning global fellowship program aimed at bringing more diversity into Open Source.

It is about helping introduce newcomers to the world of programming and further expand their knowledge and skills, by contributing to a worthwhile Open Source project. The focus is not on producing highly sophisticated code, but rather participants learning transferable skills from their project work. Apart from experience in large-scale projects, RGSoC also inculcates community building by introducing its scholars to people who maintain these projects and other members of the community involved in it.

The RGSoC team structure goes like this :

1. The Students - A pair of Students who are enthusiastic to work on a chosen Open Source Project.
2. A Project Mentor - Usually an active contributor in the Open Source Project that is chosen. He/She is responsible for guiding the students in the project related tasks, features that are to be added and overall development of the project.
3. The Project Coaches - They are selected by the students during the time of the application and might be local (present in the same location as the students) or remote. They usually help the students in handling technical difficulties throughout the course of the program.
4. The Project Supervisor - They are the representatives of the RGSoC organisational team and guide the rest of the team with the procedures of the program.

RGSoC has both the sides - technical as well as social. Apart from working on the project, we even need to get involved in social meets such as a team call with the project supervisor, maintaining daily logs about what was achieved and what challenges we encountered that day, writing blog posts about our experiences etc.

This year, 20 teams were selected among which, 16 are Sponsored teams (We are one of them :D) and 4 are Volunteer teams.

Why are we here for?

1. Learn as much as we can - JavaScript, Rust, Git, any new tech, all about microcontrollers, their protocols - Basically any and everything that RGSoC and Tessel would be able to offer us.

2. Work and contribute to the community. Scale the Tessel project, add features to it, make projects that can help the community in some way using Tessel. We really hope RGSoC would help us transition from Team 276linesofCode to Tesselators so that we can be a part of this community even after RGSoC is over.

3. Bond with the community. We've heard from our seniors and read blogs, and have always been awed by the fact that teams from different parts of the world bond together. We are so excited to meet and talk to our fellow teams, know more about them, their culture and their work!

4. Have fun!!, because why not?

We have completed one month of RGSoC. It seems just yesterday when it all started. The journey is filled with knowledge and thrills. We look forward to completing our summer of code with a zealous attitude.
