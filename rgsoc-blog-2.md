Sub themes to write on -

1. What did we do? (Screenshots of PRs, Tweets, Demos, GIFs, etc)
2. Challenges
3. Extras (Our talks in WWCD and LinuxChix India)
4. A shoutout to the amazing Tessel Community (All the people who've helped us make our PR's work)
5. How are we benefitted/Gonna use this knowledge?
6. What's next?

--------  

About two and a half months back, none of us had an idea of what this journey would be like. RGSoC had been the first Summer of Code or any other program as such that we were a part of, and our eagerness to grasp the most from the program had us going all throughout. Not to mention, we have gained so much more than we had even anticipated.

## Our Work this Summer

As we look back into our two and a half months, RGSoC and Tessel have given us opportunity to explore and grow in all spheres of an Open Source Project.

We've got our hands dirty with things like Documentation, Tutorials, Code, Hardware experiments, Talks, Presentations and even Product Design, to name a few. We started our Summer with exploring version control with GitHub and learning the intricacies of the same. A professional Open Source project has a very different approach to Pull Requests and Contributions. We learnt how to send PRs, how to get them reviewed ( Trust us, Reviews are the real deal in the learning ), how to squash commits, how to write clean code and clean commit messages, branching of cloned repositories, and most importantly, asking doubts on the issues that we don't understand.
Our Hardware modules were shipped from the US and we spent some time exploring them. This was the most exciting part - Making circuits, seeing the LEDs shimmer, watching the Accelerometer come back to life, and many many more.
After exploring the different repositories in Tessel, we started exploring issues which were Contribution starters. A lot of them were listed in the Tessel blog called "[This Week in Tessel](https://tessel.io/blog/157835574022/this-week-in-tessel-fun-with-open-source)" and we started completing them one at a time.
We made two important tutorial modules for Tessel for their documentation page. This included Fritzing diagrams of the circuits, describing the functionality in layman terms, and writing code which would be easily understood, with the help of the comments.
Apart from all the technical work, we learnt about Product Design and how exactly does a product make it's way to the Open Source domain. We made a draft of something called a Product Requirement Document (PRD) for our proposal of HAP (Humanoid Arm Project) that we had made during our application process.
