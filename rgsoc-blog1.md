Points to consider (I want to add more quirky questions to the list) -
1. Who are we? Individual Introductions - our photo
2. About the project.
3. What we have learnt till now and What we plan to do next?
4. Tips we would like to share.
5. Photo with coaches and mentor if possible(coaches, mentor intro) 
6. Achievements so far.
7. What does Open Source mean to us?
8. 

Things we need to keep in mind - 
1. Adding image credits
2. Markdown doesn't support GitHub
3. Read the how to contribute guidelines for RGSoC repo.

__INTRO GOES HERE__


## The beginning of it all

As the famous Bollywood dialogue goes -
> "Kehte hain ki... 
> Agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaaho, toh puri kayanat usey tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai" 

which means - "It is said...that if you really desire something from the heart then the whole universe will work towards getting you that.

This perfectly summarizes our journey till July'17, when we started our Summer of Code. Exactly a year back, during the Induction Programme of our freshman year at our institute was when we first met - two confused, scared and shy humans who had absolutely no idea how we would survive the tech world. We formed a small little study group (which often did all things besides studying together) of equally confused, scared and shy humans. We would hang out together in breaks, classes, post-classes and thus, the bond became stronger. 
Cut to December 2016, when we came across the RGSoC website and within no time, we decided to be a team. Fortunately, there were three teams from our institute in RGSoC 2016, which gave us some initial boost to apply. 

It was January 18th, when we were casually scrolling through the list of selected orgs in RGSoC 2017, that we came across [Tessel](https://tessel.io/) which was at the top of the list. The category tags included JavaScript, Hardware and Command Line Interface - things that both of us were extremely enthusiastic about. Within no time we found ourselves scrolling through its website and joining their slack channel. After putting up a tiny introduction, we were pinged by the project mentor, [Kelsey](https://twitter.com/ifoundtheme) who suggested that we do a video call!

It was a cold January morning on the 20th, when we had our first video call with her. She was so supportive, introducing us to some contribution starters in Tessel, along with the work culture in an Open Source project. It made us more determined to apply, now that we knew Tessel was what we wanted to work on.

It was February 2017 **(cracks knuckles)** and the application for RGSoC was in full swing. We were still devoid of coaches, which we were in dire need of. We first came across Dana (**Add link????**) in the RGSoC Google Group, who was kind enough to agree to coach us - all the way from Hong Kong! 

On 3rd February, we got in touch with Jigyasa Grover on twitter. She messaged us saying that she would be willing to coach our team during RGSoC 2017.

The whole of February went in looking for coaches for which we even approached some teams in our University which were past RGSoC scholars. During this search we got in contact with two of our seniors at our University - Sanchit Gupta and Divam Gupta (**links to be added**).
