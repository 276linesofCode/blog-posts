Points to consider (I want to add more quirky questions to the list) -
1. Who are we? Individual Introductions - our photo
2. About the project.
3. What we have learnt till now and What we plan to do next?
4. Tips we would like to share.
5. Photo with coaches and mentor if possible(coaches, mentor intro) 
6. Achievements so far.
7. What does Open Source mean to us?
8. 

Things we need to keep in mind - 
1. Adding image credits
2. Markdown doesn't support GitHub
3. Read the how to contribute guidelines for RGSoC repo.

__INTRO GOES HERE__


*** The beginning of it all! ***

As the famous Bollywood dialogue goes -
** "Kehte hain ki... 
Agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaaho, toh puri kayanat usey tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai" **
which means - "It is said...that if you really desire something from the heart then the whole universe will work towards getting you that.

This perfectly summarizes our journey till July'17, when we started our Summer of Code. Exactly a year back, during the Induction Programme of our freshman year at our institute was when we first met - two confused, scared and shy humans who had absolutely no idea how we would survive the tech world. We formed a small little study group (which often did all things besides studying together) of equally confused, scared and shy humans. We would hang out together in breaks, classes, post-classes and thus, the bond became stronger. 
Cut to December 2016, when we came across the RGSoC website and within no time, we were a team.
