Points to consider (I want to add more quirky questions to the list) -
1. Who are we? Individual Introductions - our photo
2. About the project.
3. What we have learnt till now and What we plan to do next?
4. Tips we would like to share.
5. Photo with coaches and mentor if possible(coaches, mentor intro) 
6. Achievements so far.
7. What does Open Source mean to us?
8. 

Things we need to keep in mind - 
1. Adding image credits
2. Markdown doesn't support GitHub
